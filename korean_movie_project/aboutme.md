### Abstract
Movie rating prediction is one of the most interesting topics in machine learning field, because we have continuously increasing amount of data available online. At the same time, movie rating plays an important role as we can learn whether others recommend the movie or not. It is easy to find ourselves that we highly tend to rely on othersâ€™ opinions when we search movie to watch. In this study, we explore various machine learning (ML) tools and natural language processing (NLP) methods to perform a prediction analysis of movie ratings. Prior to the prediction process, this paper presents data collection and step of data pre-processing with the introduction of Python libraries and packages available. The results show the experiment with various deep learning models and their accuracies.
